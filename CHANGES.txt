1.1.7-SNAPSHOT
--------------
o ConnectionException thrown instead of ResultProcessingException when a connection could not be obtained to Neo4j

o Fixes issue where an array property of an entity would not be saved to the graph correctly if the contents of the array were modified.
o Fixes issue where org.neo4j.ogm.json.JSONException: Unterminated string was thrown with premature closing of the response
o Improvements and bug fixes to http connection handling and connection pooling
o The reason for a Cypher statement or query failing is made available and is consistent across drivers. org.neo4j.ogm.session.result.CypherException contains the error code and message.
o Fixes issue where incoming relationships not navigable in the other direction could not be deleted
o Fixes issue where an undirected relationship was sometimes not deleted correctly

1.1.5
--------------
o Support for collections of entities of type SortedSet, backed by a TreeSet
o Fixes issue where registering an entity type and purging entities from the session were dependent on the equals() implementation of the entity
o Upgrade to Neo4j 2.3.2
o Retry http requests in the event of NoHttpResponseException
o Converters using parametrized types now work correctly
o Fixes http-client connection leak when request returns a 300/400/500 response code

1.1.4
--------------
o Fixes issue where the relationship type specified via an annotation on an iterable setter was ignored if the parameter type matched
o Fixes issue where long transaction times out and results in application hanging
o Fixes issue where loadAll was dependent on the entities implementation of equals()
o Throw MissingOperatorException when BooleanOperators are not specified in any filters except the first
o Fixes an issue where LoadByIdsDelegate returned more than the collection of requested ids
o Allows saving a relationship entity directly even when there is no reference from the relationship entity to the start node
o Fixes issue where integers returned by queries were not converted correctly to numeric wrapper classes like Float
o Fixes issue where @DateLong could not handle dates with values < INTEGER.MAX_VALUE
o Fixes relationship mapping issue when one-sided singleton relationships are reloaded after session clear
o Added support for case-insensitive, wildcard-based LIKE queries via filters
o Fixes null pointer exceptions when nulls are sent as parameters and returned from custom queries

1.1.3
--------------
o Fixes issue when entity identity was based on equals/hashcode when traversing object graph
o Performance improvements when
  - updating existing relationships by id
  - creating new relationships between already persisted nodes. Does not apply to relationship entities.
o Fixes an issue with the mapping context where node entities are deregistered, but not referenced relationship entities
o Fixes issue when type descriptors are defined on interfaces
o Fixes metadata label resolution with certain class hierarchies

1.1.2
--------------
o Improvements to class loading mechanism to support Play framework
o Fixes mapping issue when an entity contains relationships as well as relationship entities of the same type
o Support for Neo4j 2.2.5

1.1.1
--------------
o Support for self relationships (loops)
o Fixes around mapping of relationships and relationship entities when the relationship type is the same
o Fixed NullPointerException thrown from TransientRelationship.convert
o Fixed relationships being lost upon re-save
o Performance improvements
o Deprecated Session.execute() in favour of Session.query() allowing both queries and modifying statements,
with the ability to return query results as well as query statistics.
